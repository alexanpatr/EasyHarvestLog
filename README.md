# EasyHarvest

EasyHarvest aims to simplify the deployment and controlled execution of large-scale sensing applications on smartphones. On the one hand, application owners submit to a server sensing tasks for distribution on smartphones, and collect the data produced by them in a simple manner. On the other hand, smartphone owners control the execution of sensing tasks on their devices through a single interface, without having to repeatedly download, install and configure individual sensing applications. The interaction between the smartphone and the server occurs in a transparent way, with tolerance to intermittent connectivity and support for disconnected operation.
